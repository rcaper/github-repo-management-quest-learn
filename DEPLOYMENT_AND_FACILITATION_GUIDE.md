## Automated Quest Setup (GitHub Actions)

### Overview

The quest includes GitHub Actions workflows to automatically create sample issues and PRs for workshops and demos. This saves significant setup time and ensures consistent, high-quality sample data.

### Available Workflows

#### 1. Setup Quest Issues (`setup-quest-issues.yml`)

**What it does:**
- Creates 8 sample issues for Scenario 3 (Issue Management)
- Issues include bugs, documentation problems, feature requests, questions
- Some issues are intentionally duplicates or vague (for practice)
- All tagged with `quest-sample` label for easy cleanup

**When to use:**
- Before workshop: Day before or morning of
- For demos: When showing issue management capabilities
- For testing: Verify Copilot issue features work

**How to run:**

1. **Via GitHub Web Interface:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.com
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - Select "Setup Quest Issues" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Choose scenario: `scenario-3` or `all`
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Via GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run setup-quest-issues.yml
   ```

**Sample issues created:**
- Issue #1: API authentication bug (detailed)

- Issue #3: Broken link (good for auto-fix)
- Issue #4: Feature request (dark mode)
- Issue #5: Duplicate of Issue #1 (for finding duplicates)
- Issue #6: Vague issue (needs more info)
- Issue #7: Missing code import (good for auto-fix)
- Issue #8: Question (categorization practice)

#### 2. Setup Quest PR (`setup-quest-pr.yml`)

**What it does:**
- Creates a sample pull request for Scenario 2 (PR Review)
- PR includes new documentation files and updates
- Intentionally includes issues for review practice
- Creates a feature branch automatically

**When to use:**
- Before workshop: Day before
- For demos: When demonstrating PR review
- For testing: Verify Copilot PR features work

**How to run:**

1. **Via GitHub Web Interface:**
   - Go to Actions → "Setup Quest PR"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Choose PR size: `small`, `medium`, or `large`
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Via GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run setup-quest-pr.yml
   ```

**What the PR includes:**
- New integration tutorial
- Quick reference guide
- Updated README
- **Intentional issues:**
  - Outdated Python version (Python 2.7)
  - Broken link to deleted file
  - Link to old domain
  - Typo: "experiance" → "experience"

**Perfect for practicing:**
- PR review with @workspace
- Finding cross-file issues
- Generating constructive feedback
- Using Copilot's PR summary feature

#### 3. Cleanup Quest Samples (`cleanup-quest-samples.yml`)

**What it does:**

- Closes all sample PRs (labeled `quest-sample`)
- Deletes sample feature branches
- Leaves comments explaining closure
- Cleans up your repository after workshop

**When to use:**
- After workshop completion
- After demo is done
- Before next workshop (to start fresh)
- When repository needs cleanup

**How to run:**

1. **Via GitHub Web Interface:**
   - Go to Actions → "Cleanup Quest Samples"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - **Important:** Type `DELETE` to confirm
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Via GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run cleanup-quest-samples.yml -f confirm=DELETE
   ```

**Safety features:**
- Requires confirmation (must type "DELETE")
- Only affects items labeled `quest-sample`
- Leaves helpful comments on closed items
- Does not delete real issues/PRs

### Workshop Setup Checklist

**1-2 Days Before Workshop:**

- [ ] Run "Setup Quest Issues" workflow
  ```bash
  gh workflow run setup-quest-issues.yml
  ```
- [ ] Run "Setup Quest PR" workflow
  ```bash
  gh workflow run setup-quest-pr.yml
  ```
- [ ] Verify issues created (check Issues tab)
- [ ] Verify PR created (check Pull Requests tab)
- [ ] Test with GitHub Copilot
  - Open VS Code
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I`
  - Type: `@workspace Categorize all issues labeled quest-sample`
  - Verify Copilot can see and analyze them

**Day of Workshop:**

- [ ] Verify sample issues still open
- [ ] Verify sample PR still open
- [ ] Test Copilot @workspace can see them
- [ ] Have cleanup workflow ready for after

**After Workshop:**

- [ ] Run "Cleanup Quest Samples" workflow
  ```bash
  gh workflow run cleanup-quest-samples.yml -f confirm=DELETE
  ```
- [ ] Verify all samples cleaned up
- [ ] Repository ready for next workshop

### Troubleshooting Workflows

**Problem:** Workflow fails with permissions error

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Ensure repository settings have correct permissions:
# Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
# Select: "Read and write permissions"
```

**Problem:** Issues/PRs not created

**Solution:**
- Check Actions tab for workflow run logs
- Verify you have issues/PR permissions
- Check if issue/PR limits reached

**Problem:** Can't find the workflow

**Solution:**
- Workflows are in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Must be on `main` or `master` branch
- Check Actions tab is enabled in repository settings

**Problem:** Cleanup doesn't remove everything

**Solution:**
- Manually verify `quest-sample` label exists
- Check if items were created with different labels
- Use GitHub CLI to force close:
  ```bash
  gh issue close 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 --comment "Cleanup after quest"
  ```

### Manual Setup (Without Workflows)

If GitHub Actions isn't available, you can manually create sample issues:

**Quick Manual Setup:**

```bash
# Create sample issues manually
gh issue create --title "[Quest Sample] API authentication failing" \
  --body "Authentication error with valid API key..." \
  --label "quest-sample,bug"

gh issue create --title "[Quest Sample] Typo in docs" \
  --body "Line 12 has 'experiance' should be 'experience'" \
  --label "quest-sample,docs,good-first-issue"

# Repeat for other issues...
```

**Or use the provided issue templates:**
- All sample issue content is in the workflow files
- Copy/paste from `.github/workflows/setup-quest-issues.yml`
- Create issues manually via GitHub web interface

### Benefits of Automated Setup

✅ **Saves Time:**
- Manual setup: 30-45 minutes
- Automated: 2 minutes + workflow run time (1-2 min)
- Total savings: ~30-40 minutes per workshop

✅ **Consistency:**
- Same issues every time
- Ensures all practice scenarios covered
- No forgotten issues

✅ **Quality:**
- Issues are well-written
- Include all necessary details
- Demonstrate best/worst practices

✅ **Easy Cleanup:**
- One command cleans everything
- No leftover test data
- Repository stays organized

### Advanced: Customizing Workflows

**To customize sample issues:**

1. Edit `.github/workflows/setup-quest-issues.yml`
2. Modify issue titles, bodies, or labels
3. Add more issues or remove some
4. Commit and push changes
5. Run updated workflow

**Example customization:**

```yaml
# Add company-specific issue
- name: Create Company-Specific Issue
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      await github.rest.issues.create({
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        title: '[Quest Sample] Update company branding',
        body: 'Please update documentation with new company logo and colors.',
        labels: ['quest-sample', 'company-specific']
      });
```

**To customize the sample PR:**

1. Edit `.github/workflows/setup-quest-pr.yml`
2. Modify the files created in the PR
3. Change the intentional issues
4. Adjust PR description
5. Commit and run

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: AI Tool Not Responding

**Causes:**
- Network issues
- Account not authenticated
- Rate limiting
- Service outage

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Re-authenticate
3. Switch to backup AI tool
4. Use pre-written prompts as manual guide

**Facilitator Backup Plan:**
```
"Looks like [AI tool] is having issues.
Let me show you the example output I prepared...

[Show pre-generated examples]

The process is the same - you'd use this prompt:
[Show prompt]

And get a response like:
[Show example]
```

#### Issue: Participants Falling Behind

**Causes:**
- Technical difficulties
- Varying skill levels
- Unclear instructions

**Solutions:**
1. **Pause and Sync:**
   ```
   "Let's all get to the same point.
   If you're on Task 1.2, that's perfect.
   If you're still on 1.1, no problem - we'll catch you up."
   ```

2. **Breakout Support:**
   - Send struggling participants to breakout room with assistant
   - Main room continues
   - Rejoin when ready

3. **Provide Completed Examples:**
   ```
   "If you're stuck, you can use this example output:
   [Link to solution]

   Focus on understanding the process, not perfecting the output."
   ```

#### Issue: Task Taking Longer Than Expected

**Solutions:**
1. **Adjust on the Fly:**
   ```
   "This is taking longer than planned. Let's...

   Option A: Finish this together (demo remaining steps)
   Option B: Skip to highlights (show key points)
   Option C: Make this homework (provide guidance)"
   ```

2. **Prioritize Learning Objectives:**
   - Focus on most valuable skills
   - Skip less critical tasks
   - Provide summary of skipped content

#### Issue: Mixed Experience Levels

**Solutions:**
1. **Pair Programming:**
   ```
   "Let's pair up:
   - Experienced with beginner
   - Work together on tasks
   - Teach each other"
   ```

2. **Differentiated Tasks:**
   - Beginners: Follow step-by-step
   - Intermediate: Less guidance
   - Advanced: Bonus challenges

3. **Multiple Tracks:**
   ```
   Track 1 (Beginners): Follow along with me
   Track 2 (Advanced): Try Scenario 3 independently

   We'll reconvene in 20 minutes.
   ```
