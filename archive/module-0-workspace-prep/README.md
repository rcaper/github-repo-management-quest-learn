# Module 0: Workspace Preparation

## Overview

Before diving into repository management scenarios, you'll learn how to customize your GitHub Copilot workspace with agents and reusable prompts. This foundational module introduces you to `.agents` and `.prompts` files that will supercharge your productivity throughout the quest.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate

> **📚 Two-Part Lab Structure:** This module is split across both parts of the quest:
> - **[Part 1](../part-1-fundamentals/README.md)** covers Task 0.1 (Introduction) - essential concepts
> - **[Part 2](../part-2-advanced/README.md)** covers Tasks 0.2-0.4 (Advanced) - building custom agents and prompts

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

1. **Understand workspace customization** - Learn how `.agents` and `.prompts` files enhance GitHub Copilot
2. **Create custom agents** - Build specialized AI assistants for documentation tasks
3. **Design reusable prompts** - Develop template prompts for common workflows
4. **Configure your workspace** - Set up the foundation for all subsequent scenarios

## What You'll Build

- **Repository auditor agent** - Specialized in content analysis and gap identification
- **Style enforcer agent** - Ensures adherence to documentation standards
- **Prompt library** - Reusable templates for content analysis, reporting, and review tasks
- **Workspace configuration** - Custom setup that works across all scenarios

## Prerequisites

- Completed basic GitHub Copilot setup from main README
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension active
- Understanding of markdown and basic Git concepts

## Module Structure

### Task 0.1: Introduction to Agents and Prompts
Learn the fundamentals of workspace customization and see examples in action.

### Task 0.2: Creating Your First Agent
Build a simple documentation-focused agent from scratch.

### Task 0.3: Building a Prompt Library
Create reusable prompt templates for common documentation tasks.

### Task 0.4: Testing and Optimization
Test your agents and prompts, then optimize them for better performance.

## Getting Started

1. **Open this repository** in VS Code
2. **Ensure GitHub Copilot is active** (look for the Copilot icon in the status bar)
3. **Start with Task 0.1** in the `tasks/` directory
4. **Follow each task sequentially** - they build on each other

## Files You'll Create

By the end of this module, your workspace will include:

```
.agents                 # Custom agent definitions
.prompts               # Reusable prompt templates
module-0-workspace-prep/
├── my-agents-config.md    # Your agent documentation
└── my-prompts-library.md  # Your prompt collection
```
