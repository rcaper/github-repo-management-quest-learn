# Task 2.4: Automated Issue Fixes with GitHub Copilot (Issue-to-PR Workflow)

**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced  
**GitHub Copilot Features:** Assign Issue to Copilot, Copilot Coding Agent, @workspace, automated fix generation

## Objective

Use GitHub Copilot's powerful **issue-to-PR workflow** to automatically generate pull requests that fix simple issues—demonstrating GitHub Copilot's most impressive repository management capability.

## Context

In your backlog analysis, you identified several "quick win" issues that are simple, mechanical fixes:
- Typos in documentation
- Broken links
- Missing code imports in examples
- Simple formatting issues
- Outdated version numbers

Traditionally, even simple fixes require:
1. Reading the issue
2. Finding the file
3. Making the change
4. Creating a branch
5. Committing
6. Creating a PR
7. Writing PR description

**This takes 10-15 minutes per issue.**

---

## Part A: Assign Issue to Copilot (GitHub.com)

The fastest way to fix simple issues is to **assign them directly to GitHub Copilot** on GitHub.com. Copilot will analyze the issue, generate a fix, create a branch, and open a pull request—all automatically!

### How It Works

1. **Navigate to an issue** on GitHub.com
2. **Click the "Assignees" section** in the right sidebar
3. **Select "Copilot"** from the assignee list (or type `copilot`)
4. **Copilot goes to work:**
   - Analyzes the issue description
   - Identifies relevant files in the repository
   - Generates the fix
   - Creates a new branch
   - Opens a pull request with a description

### Try It: Assign a Typo Issue to Copilot

1. **Find a simple issue** in your repository (e.g., a typo or broken link from the `quest-sample` issues)

2. **Open the issue on GitHub.com**

3. **Assign to Copilot:**
   - Click **Assignees** → Select **Copilot**
   - Or use the keyboard shortcut: Press `a` then type `copilot`

4. **Watch Copilot work:**
   - A comment appears: "Copilot is working on this issue..."
   - Within seconds to minutes, a PR link appears
   - The issue shows the linked PR

5. **Review the PR:**
   - Navigate to the pull request Copilot created
   - Review the changes (Files changed tab)
   - Check that the fix is correct
   - Merge if satisfied, or request changes

### Example: Typo Fix via Assign to Copilot

**Issue:** "Typo in docs/getting-started.md - 'experiance' should be 'experience'"

**What Copilot does automatically:**

```text
✅ Creates branch: copilot/fix-typo-experiance
✅ Edits: docs/getting-started.md (line 12)
✅ Changes: "experiance" → "experience"  
✅ Opens PR: "Fix typo in getting-started.md"
✅ PR description: "Fixes typo reported in #23. Changed 'experiance' to 'experience'."
✅ Links: Closes #23
```

**Your action:** Review and merge. Done in 30 seconds!

### Best Practices for Assign to Copilot

| ✅ Works Well For | ❌ Not Ideal For |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Typo fixes | Complex logic changes |
| Broken link updates | Multi-file refactoring |
| Missing imports | Security-sensitive code |
| Simple formatting | Architectural decisions |
| Version number updates | Changes needing discussion |

> **Tip:** Write clear, specific issue descriptions. The better Copilot understands the issue, the better the fix!

## Part B: Same Workflow in VS Code

You can achieve the same issue-to-PR workflow using **Copilot Chat in VS Code**. This gives you more control over the process and lets you review/refine fixes before creating the PR.

### When to Use VS Code Instead

- You want to **preview the fix** before committing
- You need to **refine or customize** Copilot's suggestion
- The fix requires **context from multiple files**
- You want to **batch multiple fixes** together
- You prefer working in your editor

### Setup

1. **Open VS Code with your repository**

2. **Open Copilot Chat:** `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)

---

### VS Code Task 1: Fix Simple Typo

**Scenario:** An issue reports a typo in `docs/getting-started.md`: "experiance" should be "experience"

**GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt:**

```text
@workspace Issue #23 reports a typo in the getting-started guide.

Issue description: "The word 'experiance' on line 12 of docs/getting-started.md should be 'experience'"

Please:
1. Find the file and the typo
2. Show me the current line
3. Provide the corrected line
4. Suggest the exact edit I should make

After I confirm, help me create a PR to fix this.
```

**What Copilot Does:**

- Locates the exact file and line
- Identifies the typo
- Provides corrected text
- Helps create branch and PR

**Follow-up:**

```text
@workspace Create a pull request description for this typo fix. Include:
- What was fixed
- Which issue it closes
- Keep it concise (it's just a typo)

Format for GitHub PR.
```

**Example PR Description Copilot Generates:**

```markdown
## Fix typo in getting started guide

Fixed spelling error: "experiance" → "experience"

**Changes:**
- docs/getting-started.md line 12

**Closes #23**
