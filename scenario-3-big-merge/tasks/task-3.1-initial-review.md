**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**GitHub Copilot Features:** @workspace, GitHub.com PR summary, Copilot Chat

## Objective

Perform an initial high-level review of Pull Request #127 using GitHub Copilot's PR summary features and @workspace analysis to understand the scope, goals, and overall quality before diving into detailed review.

## Context

When reviewing a large PR (+847/-312 lines across 18 files), you can't read every line carefully. GitHub Copilot provides powerful features to help you understand PRs quickly:
- **GitHub.com PR Summary**: Native AI-powered PR summaries directly in the GitHub interface
- **@workspace Analysis**: VS Code integration to analyze PR changes in full repository context
- **Change Impact Analysis**: Understanding how PR changes affect the broader codebase

This task shows you how to use GitHub Copilot to work smarter, understanding the big picture before focusing on high-risk areas.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

**Before starting this task:** Ensure you have run the "Setup Quest PR" workflow to create the sample PR in your repository.

1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. Select "Setup Quest PR" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Navigate to **Pull Requests** tab to find the created PR

### For This Task You'll Use:

1. **The Sample PR on GitHub:**
   - Look for PR titled `[Quest Sample] Add advanced Copilot data agent content`
   - Use GitHub's Files Changed tab to review the changes

2. **VS Code with Copilot Chat:**
   - Open your repository in VS Code
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+I` (Mac)

3. **PR Content (created by the workflow):**
   - New content files: `copilot-advanced-scenarios.md`, `copilot-best-practices.md`, `copilot-troubleshooting.md`
   - Modified files: Updated `index.yml` with new units for the data agents module
   - All content relates to `learn-pr/wwl/implement-fabric-data-agents`

**Context:** This PR adds advanced Copilot content to the `implement-fabric-data-agents` Learn module, including new tutorials on advanced scenarios, best practices, and troubleshooting.
