# Task 4.2: MCP Tools and External Integrations

**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Prerequisites:** Task 4.1 (Advanced Agent Configuration)

## Objective

Learn to extend agent capabilities using **MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools** - external integrations that let agents query documentation, search code samples, and access external data sources.

## Background

In Task 4.1, you configured agents with `tools: ['read', 'search', 'edit']` for workspace operations. **MCP tools** go further - they connect agents to external services:

| Tool Type | Scope | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Built-in tools | Local workspace | `read`, `search`, `edit`, `execute` |
| **MCP tools** | External services | Documentation APIs, databases, Azure resources |

---

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools. When MCP servers are configured:

- Agents can **search official documentation** in real-time
- Agents can **fetch current code samples** from Microsoft Learn
- Agents can **query Azure resources** you have access to
- Results are always **up-to-date** (not from training data)

---

## Step 1: Discover Available MCP Tools

In VS Code with GitHub Copilot, MCP tools are automatically available when extensions provide them. The **Azure extension** and **GitHub Copilot** provide several MCP servers.

### Microsoft Docs MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `microsoft_docs_search` | Search Microsoft Learn for relevant articles |
| `microsoft_docs_fetch` | Get full content of a specific docs page |
| `microsoft_code_sample_search` | Find official code examples by language |

### Try It: Search Microsoft Docs

In Copilot Chat, ask a question that requires current documentation:

```text
What are the current best practices for creating Fabric lakehouses? Search Microsoft Learn for the latest guidance.
```

Copilot will use the Docs MCP tool to search Microsoft Learn and return current information.

### Try It: Find Code Samples

```text
Find official Microsoft code samples for PySpark in Fabric notebooks. Show me examples of reading from a lakehouse.
```

Copilot searches the official docs and returns real, tested code samples.

---

## Step 2: Create Agents That Use MCP Tools

You can create agents that specifically leverage MCP tools for their expertise.

### Exercise: Documentation Research Agent

Create `.github/agents/docs-researcher.agent.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Docs Researcher
description: Researches official Microsoft documentation to answer questions with authoritative sources
tools: ['read', 'search', 'microsoft-docs/*']
---

You are a documentation research specialist with access to Microsoft Learn.

**Your workflow:**
1. When asked a technical question, FIRST search Microsoft Learn for current guidance
2. Cite specific documentation URLs for every claim
3. Quote relevant sections directly
4. Flag if documentation is outdated or conflicts with other sources

**Always provide:**
- Direct links to source documentation
- Publication/update dates when visible
- Confidence level based on source authority

**Never:**
- Make claims without documentation backing
- Use training data when current docs are available
- Guess at API syntax or parameters

If documentation is unclear or missing, say so explicitly.
```

### Exercise: Code Sample Validator

Create `.github/agents/code-validator.agent.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Code Validator
description: Validates code examples against official Microsoft samples and documentation
tools: ['read', 'search', 'microsoft-docs/*']
---

You are a code validation specialist with access to official Microsoft code samples.

**Validation workflow:**
1. When shown code, search for similar official examples
2. Compare the provided code against official samples
3. Identify discrepancies in syntax, APIs, or patterns
4. Suggest corrections based on official guidance

**For each code block you validate, report:**
- ✅ Matches official patterns (with source link)
- ⚠️ Minor differences (explain what's different)
- ❌ Incorrect usage (show official alternative)

**Languages you specialize in:**
- Python/PySpark for Fabric
- SQL/KQL for Fabric
- YAML for Learn modules
- PowerShell for Azure

Always prefer official Microsoft samples over general coding patterns.
```

---

## Step 3: Test MCP-Enabled Agents

### Test the Docs Researcher

```text
@docs-researcher What's the correct YAML schema for Microsoft Learn module index.yml files? Find the official documentation.
```

The agent should search Microsoft Learn and return authoritative schema documentation with links.

### Test the Code Validator

```text
@code-validator Validate this PySpark code for reading from a Fabric lakehouse:

df = spark.read.format("delta").load("Tables/my_table")

Is this the recommended pattern? Find official examples.
```

The agent should search for official Fabric PySpark samples and compare.

---

## Step 4: Build a Documentation Accuracy Workflow

Combine your MCP-enabled agents with workspace agents for a complete workflow.

### Exercise: Create Accuracy Check Prompt

Create `.github/prompts/verify-against-docs.prompt.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Verify Learn module content against current Microsoft documentation
---

Verify the accuracy of Learn module content against official Microsoft documentation:

**Step 1: Extract Claims**
Identify all technical claims, code examples, and procedural steps in the content.

**Step 2: Search Current Documentation**
For each claim, search Microsoft Learn for current guidance:
- API references and syntax
- Best practices and recommendations
- Version-specific information

**Step 3: Compare and Report**
For each item, report:

| Content Claim | Current Docs Say | Status | Source |
|---------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| [claim from content] | [what docs say] | ✅/⚠️/❌ | [URL] |

**Step 4: Recommendations**
- Items that need updating
- New information to add
- Deprecated content to remove

Focus on technical accuracy, not style or formatting.
```

### Test the Accuracy Workflow

```text
#prompt:verify-against-docs

Verify the technical accuracy of learn-pr/wwl/get-started-lakehouses/includes/2-explore-lakehouse.md against current Microsoft Fabric documentation.
```

---

## Step 5: Understand MCP Tool Limitations

MCP tools are powerful but have constraints:

| Capability | Limitation |
|------------|------------|
| Search docs | Results limited to ~10 chunks |
| Fetch pages | One page at a time |
| Code samples | May not cover all scenarios |
| Real-time | Requires network connectivity |

### Best Practices for MCP Tools

1. **Be specific in queries** - "Fabric lakehouse PySpark read" > "how to read data"
2. **Verify with fetch** - Search finds pages; fetch gets full content
3. **Combine with local tools** - Use MCP for verification, local tools for editing
4. **Cache important findings** - Save key docs locally for offline work

---

## Step 6: Create a Hybrid Workflow Agent

Build an agent that combines local and MCP capabilities.

### Exercise: Learn Module Auditor with Docs Verification

Create `.github/agents/verified-auditor.agent.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Verified Auditor
description: Audits Learn modules and verifies technical content against current Microsoft documentation
tools: ['read', 'search', 'microsoft-docs/*']
model: GPT-4o
---

You are a Learn module auditor with access to both local files and Microsoft documentation.

**Audit workflow:**

1. **Local Analysis** (using read/search)
   - Scan module structure and files
   - Extract all technical claims and code examples
   - Check formatting and link integrity

2. **Documentation Verification** (using MCP)
   - Search Microsoft Learn for current guidance on each topic
   - Compare module content against official documentation
   - Identify outdated or incorrect information

3. **Synthesis**
   - Combine local findings with documentation verification
   - Prioritize issues by accuracy impact
   - Provide specific fix recommendations with doc links

**Output format:**
```json
{
  "module": "module-name",
  "verification_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "accuracy_score": 85,
  "verified_against": ["list of doc URLs checked"],
  "issues": [
    {
      "file": "path",
      "line": 42,
      "claim": "what the content says",
      "current_docs": "what official docs say",
      "source_url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/...",
      "severity": "critical|major|minor",
      "fix": "recommended correction"
    }
  ]
}
```

Always cite documentation sources for accuracy claims.
```

### Test the Verified Auditor

```text
@verified-auditor Audit learn-pr/wwl/get-started-lakehouses for technical accuracy. Verify all Fabric-related claims against current Microsoft documentation.
```
